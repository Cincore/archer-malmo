	<h1>The Archer Malmo Field Trip</h1>

		<p>The field trip was fun, and a great expierience.  But when they pulled up a very small portion of their work, I was shocked.  They do so much more than meets the eye.  At Archer Malmo, each employee is assigned a big role.  I still want to code in college if all possible, because I know I can do ALL things through Christ that streghtens me.</p>
		<p>The place itself is pretty cool.  The employee's offices were nice and peaceful.  They also had a view of part of the city out of their windows.  I would love to work at a place like Archer Malmo in the future.  You can also bring your dogs to work, which is awesome!  Everyone seems to be mastering their roles and having fun doing it. </p>
		<p>Time management is very important when working on projects, especially big ones.  There are fun things to do at Archer Malmo, such as play ping pong, and others.  But as Ben said, you have to be able to manage.  The work enviornment is very nice, surrounded by nice people who always have a smile on their faces.  As soon as I walked in, it felt like a good place to be.</p>
		<p>I did not expect Archer Malmo to be that fun and exciting.  Although the projects are long and take lots and lots of work, it seems like the place to be.  I am a visual learner, so that would be a good career for me.  When I get to college, I will definitley be majoring in computer science.  I've had in my mind that this is the right career for me since I was a sophomore.  I admit, I need alot more practice before I can say that I am very good at this.  I am still learning, and want to learn more.</p>
		<p>Also, the way that the information was presented revealed how organized how each and every one of the employees are.  My organization is good, but can get better.  There is always more room for imoprovement, and I won't hesitate to learn more.  I cannot wait to see what the future holds.</p>
